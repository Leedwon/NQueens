# NQueens App

## 🧠 ADR: Conflict Representation in GameEngine

### 📌 Problem

The N-Queens game requires real-time validation and visual highlighting of conflicts between queens.
As part of the game engine design, we need to decide:

How should we represent conflicts in the `GameEngine` state so that it supports real-time validation.

This representation should:

- Be efficient for real-time updates.
- Enable accurate UI rendering of conflicts.

### 🧪 Options Considered

| Representation                             | Description                                                                | Pros                                                            | Cons                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Exact Positions (`Set<BoardPosition>`)** | Store all squares where a conflict occurs.                                 | ✅ Simple for UI to render<br>✅ Precise cell-level highlighting  | ❌ Slight duplication in computation        |
| **Structured Lines (`Conflicts` class)**   | Track conflicting rows, columns, and diagonals using sets of line indices. | ✅ Compact and expressive<br>✅ Ideal for line-based highlighting | ❌ Requires transformation for UI rendering |

---

### ✅ Decision

We chose to use the **Structured `Conflicts` representation** within the `GameEngine`:

```kotlin
data class Conflicts(
    val rows: Set<Int>,
    val columns: Set<Int>,
    val majorDiagonals: Set<Int>,
    val minorDiagonals: Set<Int>
)
```

### 🧠 Rationale:

- This approach keeps the engine efficient and focused on rule evaluation, not rendering details.
- It maintains a clean separation of concerns: game logic stays in the engine; visual interpretation
  is handled in the ViewModel.
- It is more compact than storing full position sets and can be tested and reason about more easily

## 🧠 ADR: Conflict Detection Strategy in GameEngine

### 📌 Problem

In the N-Queens game, a conflict occurs when two queens threaten each other. This happens when two
or more queens are placed in the same:

- **Row**
- **Column**
- **Diagonal**:
    - **Major Diagonal**: `row - col` is equal
    - **Minor Diagonal**: `row + col` is equal

The `GameEngine` must detect these conflicts efficiently and accurately in order to support:

- Real-time validation
- Visual feedback
- Win detection logic

We need to choose an algorithm for detecting conflicts among the currently placed queens.

| Approach                | Description                                                                     | Complexity                        | Notes                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pairwise comparison** | Compare every pair of queens to check for conflict conditions.                  | O(q²), where q = number of queens | ✅ Simple to implement.<br>❌ May redundantly detect the same conflict multiple times.<br>❌ Slightly verbose for highlighting logic. |
| **Line-based counting** | Use hash maps to count how many queens exist in each row, column, and diagonal. | O(q + N), where N = board size    | ✅ More performant.<br>✅ Matches well with structured line-based conflict representation.                                           |

---

### ✅ Decision

We chose to implement line-based conflict detection using hash maps to track queen counts per:

- Row (`Map<Int, Int>`)
- Column (`Map<Int, Int>`)
- Major Diagonal (`Map<Int, Int>` for `row - col`)
- Minor Diagonal (`Map<Int, Int>` for `row + col`)

A conflict is identified when any count exceeds 1.

---

### 🧠 Rationale

- Line-based detection aligns directly with how the N-Queens rules are defined.
- It integrates naturally with our `Conflicts` structure, which represents rows, columns, and
  diagonals.
- Even though performance is not a primary concern since the board size is small, this approach is
  still more efficient.
